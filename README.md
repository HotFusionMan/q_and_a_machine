QAndAMachine
============

A Rails engine implementing a Web-accessible question-answering engine that learns from assertions of facts.

Dependencies
------------

The assertion processor requires ReVerb, which is distributed under the Academic License and therefore must be downloaded separately, from e.g., https://github.com/knowitall/reverb-core/ or http://reverb.cs.washington.edu/reverb-latest.jar .  Edit the symlink lib/reverb.jar so it points at your downloaded reverb*.jar file.
